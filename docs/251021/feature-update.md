```typescript
// Mark as completed
updateGoal(goalId, {
  status: 'completed',
  progress: 100  // Automatically set to 100%
})

// Archive
updateGoal(goalId, {
  status: 'archived'
})

// Reactivate/Restore
updateGoal(goalId, {
  status: 'active'
})
```

All changes are:
- Persisted to Supabase immediately
- Protected by RLS (users can only update their own goals)
- Reflected in real-time in the UI
- Trigger automatic `updated_at` timestamp
